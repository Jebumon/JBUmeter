# JBUmeter
This is an andorid mutlimeter! Compared to conventinal multimeter, your moblie app will be the multimeter and it can be accessed using the bluetooh connection.
The main advantage of this is very compactablie as this is an mobile app and there will be a small prob device which has no display or buttons etc that can be easily carried, 
instead my JBU multimeter will be processing all these.
I am uploading a short vedio of its working, so that you can have a better understanding.

The main libraries used are : JJOE64:GraphView    - For graphical representation on input signal
                              TextTOSpeech        - For speak out the readings
                              BluetoothAPI        - For connecting the prob - bidirectional communication
